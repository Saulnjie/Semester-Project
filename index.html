      <p>Come join us at the WORKING Science Museum 
        where we’re committed to making science 
        accessible to all.</p> </br>
      <p>
        Over the course of human history, science has 
        developed from our early understanding of fire,
        wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from
        galaxies  far away to the very buildingblocks
        of life itself.
      </p>  </br>
        The aim of our museum is to create a space where 
        everyone can experience the wonders of our 
        discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong 
        passion to continue the exploration of the 
        world around us.
        <p>
        We believe science should not be confined to the 
        textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. 
        This is why we haveover 1000 different exhibits on 
        the many varied subjects of science to explore.
        Many of these exhibits are designed for you to 
        interact with and play around to see science 
        come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – 
        they only come to life at night when everyone’s 
        gone home).
      </p> </br>
